      <h2>Viral vs Bacterial Infections: Which Medication do I Take?</h2>
      <section class="blog-post-grid">

                    <p>When it comes to taking medication, it is extremely important to take the correct one for your specific condition. One important factor to consider is what type of infection you have, as taking the wrong type of medication will not treat the infection in the manner you wish it did. While there are several other types of infections (I can go into detail in another article if requested), the two most frequent types of infections are viral infections and bacterial infections.</p>
<p> Viral infections are infections caused by a virus, which according to Cleveland Clinic, are “pieces of genetic information (DNA or RNA) inside a protective shell.” There are many types of viral infections, including respiratory, digestive system, viral hemorrhagic fevers, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), exanthematous (rash-causing) infections and neurological infections. Some types of viral infections include colds, the flu, Hepatitis viruses, ebola (can damage your blood vessels), and even COVID-19. Viral infections can be spread through respiratory droplets, direct contact, contaminated surfaces or objects, food, water, or insect bites.<p>
<p>On the other hand, bacterial infections result from bacteria, which are single-celled organisms who have genetic information encoded in a small piece of DNA. Common examples of bacterial infections include food poisoning (gastroenteritis), skin, ear or sinus infections, some STIs, bacterial pneumonia, most urinary tract infections (UTIs), strep throat and E. coli. Like viral infection, bacterial infections can be spread by contact, vector (bugs), vehicular (food/water) or the air. <p>
<p>	Both infections share similar symptoms, such as fever, head and body aches, fatigue, sore throat, cough, sneezing, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In order to treat these infections, it’s important to know that antibiotics are used only for bacterial infections, not viral infections. For example, in 2022, Azithromycin became one of the most prescribed antibiotics, as there were approximately 8.8 million issued prescriptions in 2022. The drug is used to treat bacterial infections, including bronchitis, pneumonia and STDs, yet nowadays some patients use it to treat viral infections such as the cold and influenza. Therefore, there is growing antibiotic resistance from bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae. If you want to treat viral infections, it is best to take an antiviral medication, but only for the specific illness you have (e.g. the flu, COVID-19, hepatitis B and C, and HIV). Depending on the severity of the illness, blood transfusion and post-exposure prophylaxis may be options for your illness.</p>
